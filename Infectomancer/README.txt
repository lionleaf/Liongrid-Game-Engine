The game we actually tried to make.

It is currently some humans running around, and when you tap the screen, you spawn monsters that chases them.

The algorithm that decides the motion of the humans are implemented with the ideas from this paper: http://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Papers/Gleicher/Crowds/crowd.pdf 
The implementation doesn't work too well yet though, but they move around :)
